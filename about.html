            <h2>Our Mission</h2>
            <p> At Sound Canvas, we believe that making music is hard enough. 
            Getting it heard should be simple. We were founded by musicians frustrated
            by hidden fees, opaque reporting, and restrictive contracts. Our singular mission-section
            is to <span style="font-weight: 500;">democratice music distribution</span> by offering powerful tools, 
            100% royalty retention, and complete artistic control, all backed by a 
            support team that genuinely understands the industry.</p>

                        The traditional gatekeepers of the music industry often take 
                        massive cuts for services that are now standard technology.
                         We saw an opportunity to build a platform that leverages modern 
                         infrastructure to eliminate unnecessary costs and complexioty. 
                         We are commited to treating every artist-from the bedroom producer to
                         the established independent label-as our most valuable partner
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We aren't just a tech company; we are an artist-advocacy group powered by seamless technology. We focus relentlessly
                        on speed, accuracy in payments and ensuring you, the craetor, always maintain
                        ownership and decision-making power.
